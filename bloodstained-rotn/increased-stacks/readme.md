![thumbnail.jpg](thumbnail.jpg)

## DESCRIPTION

**Increases the maximum amount of all stackable items to 999.**

includes two versions:

- Cheat version - Includes HP/MP recovery items
- Fair version - Excludes HP/MP recovery items

Mod is safe to uninstall; the item counts will remain the same but you will not be able to acquire more copies of each item past its vanilla cap.

## TECHNICAL DETAILS

Field `max` has been updated to `999` in file `PB_DT_ItemMaster.uasset` for the affected items.  
You can replace regex `"max",\s*"DuplicationIndex":\s*0,\s*"Value":\s*(\d+)` with `"max","DuplicationIndex":0,"Value":999` on the inline JSON file to achieve this.

This mod will be incompatible with any other updating this same file.
