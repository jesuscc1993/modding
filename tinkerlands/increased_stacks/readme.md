# Increased Stacks | Tinkerlands Mods

Increases max items stacks to 999.
Excludes items that have the default max stacks at 1 or 100 (this is the main difference with the example mod that already existed).
This prevents issues with certain items and coins.

Mod is safe to uninstall.
Items that are over their vanilla max stack will remain at their modded max stack.
Splitting the stack will revert them back to the vanilla max stack.
