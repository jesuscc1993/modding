# Extended Slime Suit | Tinkerlands Mods

Adds the [eye of truth](https://tinkerlands.fandom.com/wiki/Eye_Of_Truth) + [rainbow candle](https://tinkerlands.fandom.com/wiki/Rainbow_Candle) buffs to the slime suit accessory.

It wasn't that annoying to swap it in for bosses but now that banners are a thing it's more inconvenient, so I made this.

It now also has a +1 light buff and a +2 light buff.
I'm not sure if the end result is just +2 or actually +3, but the result is the total height of the screen is now visible.
